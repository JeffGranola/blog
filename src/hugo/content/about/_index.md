Hello! I'm Robin. I help tech startups avoid growing pains by leading remote
software teams.

This is my blog about software development, DevOps, and software team
leadership.

I have developed software professionally for 20 years. For the last 9 years, I
have led software teams in consulting engagements and as part of Silicon Valley
tech startups. I co-founded a Canadian software tech startup that was acquired
in 2014.

I am a consultant with [Tweag][Tweag].
