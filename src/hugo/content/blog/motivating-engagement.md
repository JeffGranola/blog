# Motivation for Employee Engagement on Software Teams

Why is it important for members of your software team to be engaged? Because it
is morally right, and because engagement so directly affects the bottom line.

In 2016, in an exploration of the prediction of team success, Gallup performed
[a pertinent meta analysis](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236468/moneyball-business-employee-engagement-meta-analysis.aspx)
of teams for which there was both team engagement data and team performance
data.

Engaged teams saw huge benefits over disengaged ones:

- A 21% increase in profitability.
- A 20% increase in sales.
- A 60% reduction in turnover.
- A 40% reduction in defects.

Whatever else you might say about employee engagement, it is hard to argue
against 21% more profit.

By itself, that outcome is worth investing in.
