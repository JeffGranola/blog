Peakon standard question library includes 14 so-called "driver" questions, falling into as many categories of questions.

The driver categories are:
1. Accomplishment
2. Autonomy
3. Environment
4. Freedom Of Opinions
5. Goal-Setting
6. Growth
7. Management Support
8. Meaningful Work
9. Organisational Fit
10. Peer Relationships
11. Recognition
12. Reward
13. Strategy
14. Workload

The questions defining the categories are (the driver questions):
1. Accomplishment:
   "Most days I feel a sense of accomplishment from what I do."
2. Autonomy:
   "I'm given enough freedom to decide how to do my work."
3. Environment:
   "My physical work environment contributes positively to my ability to do my
   job."
4. Freedom Of Opinions:
   "At work, my opinions seem to be valued."
5. Goal-Setting:
   "At work, I know what I'm expected to deliver."
6. Growth:
   "I feel that Iâ€™m growing professionally."
7. Management Support:
   "My manager provides me with the support I need to complete my work."
8. Meaningful Work:
   "The work I do is meaningful to me."
9. Organisational Fit:
   "${companyName}'s values provide a good fit with the things that I consider
   important in life."
10. Peer Relationships:
    "I can count on my coworkers to help out when needed."
11. Recognition:
    "If I do great work, I know that it will be recognised."
12. Reward:
    "I am fairly rewarded (e.g. pay, promotion, training) for my contributions
    to ${companyName}."
13. Strategy:
    "The overall business goals and strategies set by senior leadership are
    taking ${companyName} in the right direction."
14. Workload:
    "The demands of my workload are manageable."


### Accomplishment

A sense of accomplishment strongly influences an employee's perception of their
competence.  Everyone desires to feel competent; it is human nature.
Self-esteem requires that one experience oneself as competent; the intrinsic
motivation toward competence is extreme.

When an employee receives positive feedback on a task, their intrinsic
motivation to do it increases.

This question measures whether the employee's perception of their own
competence is being fueled by a sense of accomplishment.

There is no analogue to this question in the Gallup Q12.


### Autonomy

Controlling an employee's behaviour decreases intrinsic motivation, in general.
Autonomy refers to the degree of absence of behaviour control.

Peakon tries to measure autonomy with the degree of agreement with the
statement "I'm given enough freedom to decide how to do my work."

There is no analogue to this question in tha Gallup Q12.


### Environment

The physical work environment (the office) can profoundly affect work
performance and employee mood.

Regardless, the Gallup Q12 has no analogous survey question.

To signal possible problems with the physical work environment, Peakon asks
employees to what extent they agree with the statement "My physical work
environment contributes positively to my ability to do my job."


### Freedom Of Opinions

As social creatures, we human beings desire to belong to a group.  We do not
feel like we belong to a group if we cannot be ourselves - to express our
opinions.  Also, we desire to be safe.  We do not feel psychologically safe if
we are unable to express our opinions.

In Peakon, employees are asked to what extent they agree with the statement "At
work, my opinions seem to be valued." Peakon additionally offers a so-called
"sub-driver" metric related to the statement "my co-workers welcome opinions
different from their own". This latter question gets more to the issue of
psychological safety than the main driver question.

Peakon's main driver question is directly analagous to Gallup's less formally
phrased Q07 - "In ${companyName}, my opinions seem to count."


### Goal-Setting

Peakon asks the employee to what degree they agree with the statemest "At work,
I know what I'm expected to deliver."

This statement is similar to Gallup's Q01 - "I know what ${companyName} expects
of me."

There are subtle differences in these statements. The Peakon statement implies
that there are _deliverables_. The Gallup statement does not, suggesting that
the company may be seeking _behaviour_ more than _results_. So, the Peakon
statement is measuring something different than the nearest Gallup equivalent.


### Growth

Peakon's main driver statement for measuring growth is "I feel that I'm growing
professionally."

Gallup's equivalent is Q12 "This last year, I have had opportunities to learn
and grow due to ${companyName}."

Significantly, Gallup has a second related metric which presumably gives signal
about engagement that is not wholly delivered by Q12 - it is Q11: "In the last
6 months, someone in ${companyName} has talked to me about my progress at
${companyName}."

There is a third metric collected by Gallup's Q06 - "someone from
${companyName} encourages my development." This also is related to growth.

So, it appears that Gallup believes that engagement requires not only that
there be opportunities to learn and grow, but also that someone at the company
has talked to the employee about progress. Peakon's sub-driver statements for
the growth driver may measure these.


### Management Support

Peakon's main driver statement is "My manager provides me with the support I
need to complete my work."

Gallup's Q05 is closest to this metric. Notably, it does not require that the support come from management.
The statement is "Someone from ${companyName} seems to care about me as a person." This is similar to Peakon's "My manager cares about me as a person."

This is an important difference. Gallup is indicating here that the care does
not need to come from the manager, while Peakon is indicating that it does.


### Meaningful Work

Peakon's "The work I do is meaningful to me." 

Closest analogue is Q03 - "For ${companyName}, I have the opportunity to do
what I do best every day." That is to say, there is no good analogue for this
Peakon statement in the Gallup Q12.


### Organisational Fit

Peakon attempts to measure the employee's perceived fit between their values an those of the organisation.

Gallup does not do this. The closest Gallup metric comes from its survey
statement about the company mission: "The mission or purpose of ${companyName}
makes me feel that my work for ${companyName} is important." However, Peakon
also measures something that closely approixmates this in the Strategy driver.

We can conclude that Gallup does not believe in the meaningfulness of the
metrics that Peakon is collecting for the Organisational Fit driver.


### Peer Relationships

Peakon's driver statement is "I can count on my coworkers to help out when needed."

Gallup has Q09, "My fellow ${companyName} workers are committed to doing
quality work for ${companyName}." There is an exact analogue for this with
Peakon's sub-driver question with identical phrasing.

Notably, the Gallup Q10 is absent from Peakon. It is "I have a best friend at
${companyName}." !


### Recognition

Peakon's main driver statement is "if I do great work, I know that it will be recognised."

Gallup's analogous statement is "In the last week, I have received recognition
or praise for doing good work for ${companyName}."

There is a big difference between these. In Peakon's version, the metric is of
the employee's perception about receiving future recognition. In the Gallup
version, the employee must assert that the recognition came in the last week.
Gallup is forcing the employee to question their own prediction by simply
giving an historical fact.


### Reward

It is notable that Gallup does not ask about reward or compensation.


### Strategy

Peakon's main driver statement is "the overall business goals and strategies set by senior leadership are taking ${companyName} in the right direction."

Gallup's closest is "the mission or purpose of ${companyName} makes me feel
that my work for ${companyName} is important". This is very different, however.
This question is about how the employee feels about their own work; it is not
about the strategies and goals of the company.


### Workload

Peakon measures opinions about workload with "the demands of my workload are
manageable". Whereas, Gallup does not attempt to measure any such thing.

Engagement is a powerful determinant of team performance. If you lead a
software team, then consider measuring its degree of engagement. Measuring
engagement will help you to improve it.

This article recommends language to use in carefully selected questions for the
measurement of engagement of your software team.

Gallup has been collecting business metrics for decades; the company has been
able to authoritatively deduce which survey questions best measure engagement.
They have tuned a 12-item questionnaire (called The Gallup Q12) to measure it.
The Gallup Q12 has become the industry's gold standard for engagement.

In 2016, Gallup posted a pertinent summary of its meta-analysis of employee
engagement, including the text for the 12 questions. I won't repeat the key 12
questions here. Please see
[that post](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236468/moneyball-business-employee-engagement-meta-analysis.aspx)
before continuing.

Here, I explain how to better phrase those 12 survey questions for your
software team.


### The Term "At Work" Is Now Ambiguous

The phrase "at work" is used frequently in the Q12, but in the new world of
work, the term is ambiguous.

In the new world of work, work is not done uniquely for one company, nor is it
done uniquely at the office.

Does "at work" refer to activities done solely at the office (where an employee
is "at work")? What about company activities done "at home"? Can one be both
"at work" and "at home"?

The new work environment includes gigs and side hustles. If I work on my side
hustle while at the office, is that what we are asking about with the phrase
"at work"? Perhaps I have two jobs; does the phrase "at work" refer to both?

Because of societal changes, language changes in the survey questions are
required. The phrase "at work" must be revisited in each case.


### Q01

In this question about role clarity, the phrase "at work" is now ambiguous.

We must make sure that the survey question delivers information about *only*
the respondent's organizational affiliation for which you want to gather
engagement information.

My suggested new phrasing is:

  > I know what ${companyName} expects of me.


### Q02

In this question, the concept of "materials" does not apply to software teams.
The analogue for material, in the context of software teams, is information -
credentials, access, permissions. Subscriptions to software-as-a-service are
often required for software team members to do their jobs.

I recommend splitting this question into 3 different questions in order to
collect the relevant data:

  > I have the equipment that I need to do my ${companyName} work properly.
  >
  > I have the credentials, access, and permissions that I need to do my
  > ${companyName} work properly.
  >
  > I have the software licenses and service subscriptions that I need to do my
  > ${companyName} work properly.


### Q03

In this question, the phrase "at work" again yields ambiguity. Must the "doing"
occur at the office? What if "what I do best" is done at the office, but the
company didn't actually want me doing that work?

Here is a phrasing that corrects the ambiguity that has arisen due to changing
context - work-from-home, side hustles, and millenial work habits:

  > For ${companyName}, I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day.


### Q04

This question leaves open an opportunity for improvement - making it about the
company or organization. My suggested phrasing:

  > In the last week, I have received recognition or praise for doing good work
  > for ${companyName}.

The unmodified phrasing from Gallup allows for the possibility that the
respondent is giving information unrelated to the company or organization,
which my phrasing avoids.


### Q05

This question could be more terse, and should avoid the "at work" phrasing
mentioned above.

Note that the phrase "seems to care" cannot be replaced with "cares". Besides
the fact that it deviates too much from the well-measured Q12, it would require
the respondent to have tremendous faith in their own ability to judge caring.
The "seems to care" phrasing allows more doubt on the respondent's behalf.

My suggested alternative phrasing:

  > Someone from ${companyName} seems to care about me as a person.


### Q06

In this question about opportunity to develop, the Gallup-standard "at work"
phrasing should be removed for the reasons discussed above. I suggest:

  > Someone from ${companyName} encourages my development.


### Q07

In this question about opinions counting, we again should avoid "at work"
phrasing. My alternative:

  > In ${companyName}, my opinions seem to count.


### Q08

In this question, the phrase "my company" is ambiguous. Do you mean the
respondent's side hustle business? Even if not, does the respondent even
consider ${companyName} to be "their company"? We must remove the ambiguity.

Also, the phrase "my job" would have been interpreted differently in prior
years than more recently. In prior years, it is more likely that respondents
interpreted "my job" to mean "me in the job that I have with ${companyName}".
Now, it is more likely that respondents interpret "my job" to mean "the role
that I now occupy but which might at some other time be occupied by someone
else". We must change the phrasing to achieve the interpretation of the the
respondents of prior years. I suggest "my work for ${companyName}".

My suggestions give rise to this new phrasing:

  > The mission or purpose of ${companyName} makes me feel that my work for
  > ${companyName} is important.


### Q09

The phrase "my associates or fellow employees" gives rise to so much ambiguity,
I am surprised that it persists in the Q12. Is the respondent being asked
whether associates *and* fellow employees *generally* are committed to doing
quality work? Or, is the respondent being asked whether one group or the other
is *generally* committed to doing quality work? What if the fellow employees
are divided into "associated" and "non-associated" groups, then what is the
response to be if only one group is committed to doing quality work?

Due to the ambiguity about "work", we also wonder whether respondents might
answer when thinking about their fellow employee's work on their side hustles,
and not about work done for the company.

My suggested alternative phrasing:

  > My fellow ${companyName} workers are committed to doing quality work for
  > ${companyName}.


### Q10

Change "at work" like so:

  > I have a best friend at ${comanyName}.


### Q11

Change "at work" as above, and also clarify that it is the respondent's
progress on company-related matters that is significant:

   > In the last 6 months, someone in ${companyName} has talked to me about my
   > progress at ${companyName}.


### Q12

Change "at work" to specify that we are interested in the context of activities
done for the company:

  > This last year, I have had opportunities to learn and grow due to
  > ${companyName}.


### Caveat

This is my best effort to update the Q12 for the modern work environment.

While the Gallup Q12 are very well tested phrasings, my slightly altered
suggested phrasings, above, are untested.
