# Managing Up

Who am I to suggest these things?
- Have a boss.
- Am a boss.

What is a manager?
- Responsibility for outcomes.

Versus non-manager?
- Responsibility for efforts.

When it is needed:

- Manager is overly busy.
- Manager is disengaged.

Managing up is:
- doing what is needed to make your manager's job easier
- managing your manager
- using what you know to help your manager's job be done

Up-managing cheat sheet:
1. Understand what you manager wants.
2. Communicate your goals.
3. Carefully consider what is worth discussing.
4. Provide solutions, not problems.

Techniques:
(1) Communicate your priorities and seek feedback.
(2) Unburden your manager by taking on some unit of her work that you understand, if you are able.
(3) Get to know your boss to be able to succinctly communicate with effectiveness.
(4) Learn the right way to discuss team problems.
(5) Establish a trusting, positive relationship.
(6) Pursue self-sufficiency.

Anti-Techniques:
- Being a suck up. (Ruins trust.)

Outcomes:
- Better relationship with employer.
- Increased productivity.
- Boosts employee engagement levels.
- More empowered team.

Agile practice of daily standup meeting accomplishes (1).
Also, the Basecamp-led practice of weekly checkins ("What did you accomplish this week?" - get ref.)
