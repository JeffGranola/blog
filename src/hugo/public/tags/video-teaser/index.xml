      <description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of a software team is to complete a mission. If you are a software
team leader, your success is defined by the accomplishment of that mission; you
must own the result 100%.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Motivating Psychological Safety</title>
      <link>https://blog.robinbb.com/blog/motivating-psychological-safety/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When team members feel safe to take risks and to exhibit vulnerability, team
performance improves. When that safety is absent, team members hold back ideas
and team performance is impeded. Leaders can increase team effectiveness by
creating a psychologically safe work environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tip: Coaching Means Giving Less Advice</title>
      <link>https://blog.robinbb.com/blog/tip-coaching-means-giving-less-advice/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.robinbb.com/blog/tip-coaching-means-giving-less-advice/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coaching well means giving less advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you lead a software team, then you probably deliver coaching for improving
certain behaviours of your team members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing that, never give more than 3 pieces of advice. Your advice should be
constructive, never merely a critique. Aim for giving only 1 piece of advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because we human beings have a limited capacity for change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tip: Routinely Develop Your Influence</title>
      <link>https://blog.robinbb.com/blog/tip-routinely-develop-your-influence/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.robinbb.com/blog/tip-routinely-develop-your-influence/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are a software team leader, then you will need to make change on your
team or within your company.  That is by definition; leaders make change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social influence is what enables you to make change. Making time to develop
this influence is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methodically developing your social influence is much more effective than
allowing your degree of social influence to develop &amp;ldquo;by accident&amp;rdquo;. Make it part
of your routine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is important for members of your software team to be engaged because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;engagement improves your team&amp;rsquo;s effectiveness, and;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working to engage employees inspires the trust that is required to lead.&lt;/li&gt;
