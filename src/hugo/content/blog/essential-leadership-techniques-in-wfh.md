WFH table stakes:

0. Reliable internet access.
1. Computer equipment (including video camera and microphone).
2. Group-centric instant messaging software. (eg. Slack, IRC,
   [Element](https://element.io/),
   [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/).)
3. Video conferencing software. (eg. Zoom,
   [BlueJeans](https://www.bluejeans.com/),
   [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/).)
4. Online communication tools that assist with asynchronous communication (eg.
   forum software like [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/),
   [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com), source code management repositories,
   issue tracking tools like Phabricator or Jira).
5. Phone call emergency contact information shared as appropriate.
6. Preference for asynchronous communication (online forums, code in a
   distributed repository, even email) over synchronous communication (instant
   messaging, video conferencing, or phone calls).
7. A clear way to submit your work deliverables.


### What is Leadership?

Leadership is the practice of social influence. The function of leadership is
to produce change. The skills of leadership are those required to produce that
change.

Leadership has nothing to do with seniority, title, or position in a company's
hierarchy. One does not need a title to lead. Granted, a title gives one social
license to practice leadership, but a management title does not necessarily
mean that one is doing so.

Leadership is not the possession of any certain personal attributes. No
specific personality characteristics are required to lead.

#### Leadership versus Management

Leadership and management are not the same thing. They are 2 distinct but
complementary systems of action. Managers add structure and promote stability
of work systems.  In contradiction, leaders press for change. Most companies
are over-managed but under-led.

Management plans, schedules, and budgets. Leadership sets direction and strategy.

Management organizes and staffs. Leadership aligns people.

Management controls and problem solves. Leadership motivates and inspires.

Note that leaders must be great communicators, great knowers of people. They
must have emotional intelligence.
Leaders must generate highly energized behaviour.

### The Purpose of Leadership

The purpose of leadership is to effect positive change. You want to improve the
effectiveness of your team.

One way to measure team effectiveness is to use team engagement as a proxy.
Engaged teams are 4 times more likely to be successful than disengaged ones.


### The Skill of Leadership

- Ability to acquire and analyze information required for constructing a vision.
- Imagination for creating the vision.
- The ability to communicate the vision.

How to Lead Well

- Daniel Goleman's ["What Makes a Leader" on HBR](https://hbr.org/2004/01/what-makes-a-leader)
  The thesis is that emotional intelligence is necessary for effective
  leadership. Intelligence and technical skills are merely "threshold
  capabilities".

## Remote Work Tips

These are techniques for improving the day-to-day activities of leadership when
they are being done in a work-from-home environment.

Document the vision. Don't assume that it is shared between employees.

Tip: the social activities required in a remote environment are the same,
remote versus in-person. You probably internalized how to do some of this in-person...

Tip: grant autonomy. Use ROWE.

Tip: clarify expectations. Previous IRL interactions might have allowed for
clarifying expectations "as you go". Now, they should be better defined and
documented in advance.

Tip: show by example how best to use the remote work tools (messaging, video
calls, asynchronous work).

Tip: recognize that the current pandemic is not "normal" working from home.
Stress from non-work situation is much greater. Employers can help by
minimizing stressors from work.

Tip: don't be afraid of repeating communications that assist with your
leadership. Being thought repetitive is better than employees becoming
unaligned, disengaged, or otherwise under-led.

Tip: conduct conversations so that group members can see that other group
members are aligned, engaged, and share the vision.

Tip: keep doing what previously worked (like measuring engagement), but expect
inferior results.

Tip: reach outside your organization for help. Now that "coming to the office"
is no longer a requirement of the outside help, it is much easier for remote
consultants to connect with now-remote employees. This is an opportunity for
up-skilling your team with short term consultation. Reconsider whether that
internal job, which will take months to hire for, can be at least partially
filled by a consultant.

Tip: employees should have a distinct "working" and "not working" state that
can be more difficult to achieve when no longer cued by their physical
location. Coach how to achieve this. Otherwise, teammates will feel like they
are always working, which leads to too much stress, reduced performance, and
burnout.

Tip: create the accidental connections that would have happened in a physical
office. They can spark new ideas, and are good for our health.
(Schmooze or lose.)

Tip: Model online relationship-building for others. Conduct
relationship-building in an "open" forum (eg. a company-wide Slack channel).
This will model to others how to create online relationships.

Tip: overcommunicate. Repeat yourself often. 

Tip: be sensitive to burnout. Lack of body language cues means that you must
ask about this directly, and discuss.

Tip: monitor for loneliness. Note that one need not be alone to be lonely. It
is possible to guard against this by encouraging online social meetings (eg.
weekly "happy hours").
