      <description> I help companies avoid growing pains by leading software teams.
This is my blog about software development, DevOps, and leadership.
I have developed software professionally for 20 years. I have led software teams in consulting engagements and as part of Silicon Valley tech startups. I co-founded a Canadian software startup that was acquired in 2014.
I am a global software leadership consultant with Tweag.
