It is important for members of your software team to be engaged for 2 reasons:

1. Because engagement so positively affects your team's effectiveness, and;
2. Because working to engage employees inspires the trust that is required to
   lead.

This article introduces the motivation for employee engagement for new leaders
of software teams.

### Team Performance

In 2016, in an exploration of the prediction of team success, Gallup performed
[a pertinent meta analysis][1] of teams for which there was both team
engagement data and team performance data.

Engaged teams saw huge benefits over disengaged ones. Comparing the top
quartile to the bottom quartile for engagement, Gallup observed:

- A 21% increase in profitability.
- A 20% increase in sales.
- A 60% reduction in turnover.
- A 40% reduction in defects.

Whatever else you might say about employee engagement, it is hard to argue
against 21% more profit.

By itself, that makes your team's degree of engagement worth investing in.

My experience has been that many software managers believe that there is no
*data* about the right way or the wrong way to manage teams. They are mistaken.
In fact, some aspects of management and leadership are well studied. Engagement
is one such aspect. [Gallup studied 1.8 million employees][2] since 1997 to
deduce the precise relationship between engagement and results.


### Trust and Team Leadership

The social influence required for leadership requires that leaders be trusted.
Trust is engendered primarily by authenticity, well explained logical thinking,
and empathy. That authentic empathy from the leader for the other, if present,
will motivate the leader to advocate for engaged fellow workers.

Disengaged employees are often unhappy or unsatisfied. Those emotions often
spill over into their personal lives. Once there, the feelings cross over into
other family members. Entire families can be made unhappy by disengaged
workers.  Empathetic leaders care about fellow workers and endeavour to avoid
this unnecessary suffering.

Addressing employee engagement shows empathy, which builds trust, which is
required to lead.

That is why leaders should care about employee engagement.
