Making change on your software team will require leadership. You need not be
the boss to lead, but you must know how. Leadership best practices have changed
in the work-from-home era. This article identifies the new essential
techniques.

This is the blog post to accompany the Skills Matter talk of 13 August 2020,
["Essential Techniques for Leading Software Teams in the Work From Home Era"](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/13127-essential-techniques-for-leading-software-teams-in-the-work-from-home-era).

<!--more-->


Leadership is the practice of social influence. Anyone can lead; team
leadership is not restricted to the nominated leaders. This article is for
members of software teams; it aims to inform all team stakeholders - engineers,
designers, product owners, and, yes, designated managers. I give the new
essential work-from-home leadership practices.

I begin by presenting a 2-part context for understanding the new essential
leadership techniques. The first part of the context is understanding the new
normal state of working from home, and the basic needs of the remote worker in
that context. The second part of the context is understanding what leadership
really is. With the context given, I'll then describe essential techniques for
effectively leading software teams â€” techniques gleaned from 15 years of remote
work with software development organizations.

This is not an article about how to better use Slack and Zoom. It is about
techniques without which your leadership efforts will fall flat when working
remotely.

Slides for this talk are [here](/slides/robinbb-skills-matter-2020-08-13.pdf).

### Context, Part 1: Work-From-Home Needs

WFH table stakes:

0. Reliable internet access.
1. Computer equipment (including video camera and microphone).
2. Group-centric instant messaging software. (eg. Slack, IRC,
   [Element](https://element.io/),
   [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/).)
3. Video conferencing software. (eg. Zoom,
   [BlueJeans](https://www.bluejeans.com/),
   [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/).)
4. Online communication tools that assist with asynchronous communication (eg.
   forum software like [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/),
   [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com), source code management repositories,
   issue tracking tools like Phabricator or Jira).
5. Phone call emergency contact information shared as appropriate.
6. Preference for asynchronous communication (online forums, code in a
   distributed repository, even email) over synchronous communication (instant
   messaging, video conferencing, or phone calls).
7. A clear way to submit your work deliverables.

### Essential Techniques for Leading Remote Teams

Understanding the activities of leadership gives us the grounding required to
question what about leadership must change in a remote work setting versus a
traditional office setting.  What is essential to leadership remains the same.
The techniques required to practice are what have changed in a work-from-home
setting.

Here are my choices of essential techniques for improving the day-to-day
activities of leadership when they are being done in a work-from-home
environment.

0. Recognize what was communicated with body language.
1. Document the vision.
2. Use ROWE.
   - Clarify expectations.
3. Overcommunicate.
   - Use words to replace body language.
   - Allow time for this.
4. Demonstrate exemplary remote tool use.
   - Model online relationship-building.
   - Conduct "public" conversations.
   - Schmooze or lose.
5. Watch for WFH habit problems.
   - Monitor for burnout.
   - Monitor for loneliness.
6. Reach outside the company.


#### Recognize What Was Communicated With Body Language

Tip: the social activities required in a remote environment are the same,
remote versus in-person. You probably internalized how to do some of this in-person...

- Nodding in approval, or lack thereof, when seeking buy-in.
- Smiling when presented with a proposed course of action.
- Physical energy when discussing a topic, a metric for enthusiasm.


#### Document The Vision

Don't assume that it is shared between employees.


#### Use ROWE

Results-oriented work environments (ROWEs) are described in the book "Work Sucks".

grant autonomy

Tip: clarify expectations. Previous IRL interactions might have allowed for
clarifying expectations "as you go". Now, they should be better defined and
documented in advance.


#### Overcommunicate

Tip: don't be afraid of repeating communications that assist with your
leadership. Being thought repetitive is better than employees becoming
unaligned, disengaged, or otherwise under-led.


#### Demonstrate Exemplary Remote Tool Use

Tip: show by example how best to use the remote work tools (messaging, video
calls, asynchronous work).

Tip: recognize that the current pandemic is not "normal" working from home.
Stress from non-work situation is much greater. Employers can help by
minimizing stressors from work.

Tip: conduct conversations so that group members can see that other group
members are aligned, engaged, and share the vision.

Tip: employees should have a distinct "working" and "not working" state that
can be more difficult to achieve when no longer cued by their physical
location. Coach how to achieve this. Otherwise, teammates will feel like they
are always working, which leads to too much stress, reduced performance, and
burnout.

Tip: create the accidental connections that would have happened in a physical
office. They can spark new ideas, and are good for our health.
(Schmooze or lose.)

Tip: Model online relationship-building for others. Conduct
relationship-building in an "open" forum (eg. a company-wide Slack channel).
This will model to others how to create online relationships.

Tip: overcommunicate. Repeat yourself often. 

Tip: be sensitive to burnout. Lack of body language cues means that you must
ask about this directly, and discuss.

Tip: monitor for loneliness. Note that one need not be alone to be lonely. It
is possible to guard against this by encouraging online social meetings (eg.
weekly "happy hours").


#### Reach Outside the Company

Tip: reach outside your organization for help. Now that "coming to the office"
is no longer a requirement of the outside help, it is much easier for remote
consultants to connect with now-remote employees. This is an opportunity for
up-skilling your team with short term consultation. Reconsider whether that
internal job, which will take months to hire for, can be at least partially
filled by a consultant.
