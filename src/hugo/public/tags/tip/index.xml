      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are the leader of a software team, then you have heard of the legendary
10x developer - the superstar worker. To improve your team’s productivity,
learn this: replacing an average worker with a superstar worker is not nearly
as effective as removing a toxic worker. It’s not even close. Toxic workers
destroy productivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you lead a software team, and a team member has a problem, you may be

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you a software leader worried that the team members don’t like you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can stop worrying. They don’t have to like you. They just have to trust
you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tip: Coaching Means Giving Less Advice</title>
      <link>https://blog.robinbb.com/blog/tip-coaching-means-giving-less-advice/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.robinbb.com/blog/tip-coaching-means-giving-less-advice/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coaching well means giving less advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you lead a software team, then you probably deliver coaching for improving
certain behaviours of your team members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing that, never give more than 3 pieces of advice. Your advice should be
constructive, never merely a critique. Aim for giving only 1 piece of advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because we human beings have a limited capacity for change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tip: Routinely Develop Your Influence</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are a software team leader, then you will need to make change on your
team or within your company.  That is by definition; leaders make change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social influence is what enables you to make change. Making time to develop
this influence is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methodically developing your social influence is much more effective than
allowing your degree of social influence to develop &amp;ldquo;by accident&amp;rdquo;. Make it part
of your routine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
