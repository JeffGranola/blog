I make winning software teams by providing hands-on engineering leadership.

I am best:

- as a bridge while recruiting for a permanent CTO; or
- in a small company that needs strategic IT improvements but not a long-term
  CTO; or
- when building Canadian software technology subsidiaries.

I am a technical leader with a strong software engineering background who can
also speak the language of business. I inspire confidence among even the most
elite software teams, allowing me make rapid change. My onboarding time is
minimal.

I develop talent, launch sustainable processes, tend to the culture, optimize
team performance, and mentor leaders.

I am a technology visionary who gives crucial insight to business strategy.
