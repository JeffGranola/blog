Our tech startup business was acquired. The acquisition was even

Sweet.

_UserEvents_ first took life when its (then soon-to-be) founder and CEO pitched
me the idea at a coffee shop in Fredericton, Canada.

UserEvents was acquired by
<a href="https://www.liveops.com/about-us/" target="_blank">LiveOps</a>,
as they announced yesterday.

I formed the software technology company with Jeff Thompson and Trevor Bernard
in 2012.

My role as CTO of UserEvents was, as per my LinkedIn profile:

> Co-founded company; architected, designed, and developed software requiring a
> deep understanding of computing; conceptualized and implemented a highly
> available system to process huge data volumes in real time; custom-made
> distributed in-memory storage systems; created patentable computing systems;
> supervised graduate-level research projects; attracted technical talent.

The UserEvents engine was written in the Haskell programming language.
