[Nix](https://nixos.org/) is a software system for the management of software
packages.

In some contexts, *Nix* is a term used to mean NixOS, the computer operating
system based on the Nix package management system.

In other contexts, *Nix* refers to the
[Nix programming language](https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ch-expression-language),
which is used to declare expressions which are instantiated into software
artifacts.

Finally, the term *Nix* is sometimes used to refer to
[Nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs),
the largest single set of packages defined for the Nix package management
system.


## Correct Usage

Nix = Package manager  
NixOS = Operating system  
Nix expression = Programming language  
Nixpkgs = Particular set of Nix expressions (packages)
