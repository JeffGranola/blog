It is important for members of your software team to be engaged for 2 reasons:
Because it is morally right, and because engagement so positively affects your
team's effectiveness.

In 2016, in an exploration of the prediction of team success, Gallup performed
[a pertinent meta analysis](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236468/moneyball-business-employee-engagement-meta-analysis.aspx)
of teams for which there was both team engagement data and team performance
data.

Engaged teams saw huge benefits over disengaged ones:

- A 21% increase in profitability.
- A 20% increase in sales.
- A 60% reduction in turnover.
- A 40% reduction in defects.

Whatever else you might say about employee engagement, it is hard to argue
against 21% more profit.

By itself, that makes your team's degree of engagement worth investing in.
