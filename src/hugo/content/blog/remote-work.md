# Remote Work

Interaction fuels action (Law of Communication).

IRL interactions provide the communicator with feedback on whether their
message is being understood. Online, that is not so, or less so. Stop
frequently in communications to determine if your message is being heard and
understood.


Challenges unrelated to remote work in the work-from-home era:

- Changing markets.
- Weaker economy.
- Slower sales.
- Pretending that work-from-home is temporary and therefore ignoring the new
  challenges.

- Newly remote teams now challenge their managers and leaders to build
  influence in a new way: from home.
- Since influence is a social phenomenon, it is significantly influenced by
  in-person communication cues.

Tips:

- Work with your cohabitants (family, roommates) to create times and spaces
  where you can mentally focus and concentrate.
  - Consider a separate work space with closed door.
  - Discuss the importance of this with family and partner.
  - Coach children to understand this fundamental new life skill.
  - Create a physical environment which supports this - closed doors, signs,
    posted schedules, disabled messaging, asynchronous messages.

- Decide how you will maintain existing relationships that were previously
  assisted by an office.
  - More online messaging.
  - More personal content in messages.
  - Take the opportunity to purge unhealthy relationships.
  - Take stock of your friends, coworkers, contacts, and family; plan how to
    pro-actively communicate with members of each.
