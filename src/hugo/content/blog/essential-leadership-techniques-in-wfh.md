WFH table stakes:

0. Reliable internet access.
1. Computer equipment (including video camera and microphone).
2. Group-centric instant messaging software. (eg. Slack, IRC,
   [Element](https://element.io/),
   [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/).)
3. Video conferencing software. (eg. Zoom,
   [BlueJeans](https://www.bluejeans.com/),
   [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/).)
4. Online communication tools that assist with asynchronous communication (eg.
   forum software like [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/),
   [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com), source code management repositories,
   issue tracking tools like Phabricator or Jira).
5. Phone call emergency contact information shared as appropriate.
6. Preference for asynchronous communication (online forums, code in a
   distributed repository, even email) over synchronous communication (instant
   messaging, video conferencing, or phone calls).
7. A clear way to submit your work deliverables.


### What is Leadership?

Leadership is the practice of social influence, often in pursuit of a goal.

Leadership has nothing to do with seniority, title, or position in a company's
hierarchy. One does not need a title to lead. Granted, a title gives one social
license to practice leadership, but a management title does not necessarily
mean that one is doing so.

Leadership is not the possession of any certain personal attributes. No
specific personality characteristics are required to lead.

Leadership and management are not the same thing. They are 2 distinct but
complementary systems of action. Managers add structure and promote stability
of work systems.  In contradiction, leaders press for change. Most companies
are over-managed but under-led.

Companies plan. Company management accomplishes the plan by setting goals,
defining tasks to accomplish the goals, and allocating resources to the tasks.
In contrast, company leadership sets the direction by developing a vision along
with strategies for achieving that vision.

### The Purpose of Leadership

The purpose of leadership is to effect positive change. You want to improve the
effectiveness of your team.

One way to measure team effectiveness is to use team engagement as a proxy.
Engaged teams are 4 times more likely to be successful than disengaged ones.

How to Lead Well

- Daniel Goleman's ["What Makes a Leader" on HBR](https://hbr.org/2004/01/what-makes-a-leader)
  The thesis is that emotional intelligence is necessary for effective
  leadership. Intelligence and technical skills are merely "threshold
  capabilities".

Tip: grant autonomy. Use ROWE.

Tip: recognize that the current pandemic is not "normal" working from home.
Stress from non-work situation is much greater. Employers can help by
minimizing stressors from work.


Tip: keep doing what previously worked (like measuring engagement), but expect
inferior results.
