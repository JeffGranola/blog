teams.</p>

This is my blog about software development, DevOps, and leadership.

I have developed software professionally for 20 years.  I have led software
teams in consulting engagements and as part of Silicon Valley tech startups. I
co-founded a Canadian software startup that was acquired in 2014.

I am a global software leadership consultant with [Tweag](https://tweag.io/).
