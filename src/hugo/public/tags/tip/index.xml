      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you lead a software team, and a team member has a problem, you may be
tempted to solve it. Maybe you shouldnâ€™t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an opportunity for more than a solved problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tip: Coaching Means Giving Less Advice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coaching well means giving less advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you lead a software team, then you probably deliver coaching for improving
certain behaviours of your team members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing that, never give more than 3 pieces of advice. Your advice should be
constructive, never merely a critique. Aim for giving only 1 piece of advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because we human beings have a limited capacity for change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are a software team leader, then you will need to make change on your
team or within your company.  That is by definition; leaders make change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social influence is what enables you to make change. Making time to develop
this influence is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methodically developing your social influence is much more effective than
allowing your degree of social influence to develop &amp;ldquo;by accident&amp;rdquo;. Make it part
of your routine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
