      <description>&lt;p&gt;Teams exist to complete a mission. If you are a software team leader, you must
ensure that the team’s mission is well defined and clearly communicated.
Without a clear mission, your team’s ability to make decisions is grossly
impeded, as is your ability to set goals and measure progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, I have encountered many software shops in which the mission is unclear or
absent. Failing to clearly communicate a mission is a leadership mistake of the
highest order.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
