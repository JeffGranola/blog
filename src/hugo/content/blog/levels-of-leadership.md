# Levels Of Leadership

Levels of leadership is useful language for discussing leadership skills.
(Advanced by John Maxwell Company Executive Leadership.)

Leadership is the practice of influence.

The 5 levels of leadership are:

1. Position Level. (Rights Level.)
   Influence relies on title, rules, policies, and org chart. 80% of "leaders"
   remain here. Turnover is high. Retention is low. However, position buys you
   time to improve.

2. Permission Level.
   Relies on relationships. Followers want to follow.

3. Production Level.
   Relies on results. Followers are due to wins. Morale, profits are up. Goals
   are achieved.

4. Reproduction Level.
   Relies on people development. Relies on what you have done for people,
   personally. Must empower others.

5. Pinnacle Level.
