You should care about the degree of engagement of your team.
Engagement is a powerful determinant of performance.

<!--more-->

Gallup has been collecting business metrics for decades; the company has been
able to authoritatively deduce precisely which survey questions best measure
engagement. They have tuned a 12-item questionnaire (called The Gallup Q12) to
measure it. The Gallup Q12 has become the industry's gold standard for
engagement.

In 2016, Gallup posted a pertinent summary of its meta-analysis of employee
engagement.  I won't repeat the key 12 questions here, so please see the
[that post](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236468/moneyball-business-employee-engagement-meta-analysis.aspx)
before continuing.

Here, I'll explain how to better phrase those 12 survey questions for your
software team.


### Q01

In this question about role clarity, the phrase "at work" is now ambiguous.

In the new world of work, work is not done uniquely for one company, nor is it
done uniquely at the office.

We must make sure that the survey question delivers information about *only*
the respondent's organizational affiliation for which you want to gather
engagement information.

My suggested new phrasing is:

  > I know what ${companyName} expects of me.


### Q02

In this question, the concept of "materials" does not apply for software teams.
The analogue for material, in the context of software teams, is information -
credentials, access, permissions. Subscriptions to software-as-a-service are often required for software team members to do their jobs.

I recommend splitting this question into 3 different questions in order to collect the relevant data:

- I have the equipment that I need to do my ${companyName} work properly.
- I have the credentials, access, and permissions that I need to do my
  ${companyName} work properly.
- I have the software licenses and service subscriptions that I need to do my
  ${companyName} work properly.


### Q03

In this question, the phrase "at work" again yields ambiguity? Must the "doing"
occur at the office? What if "what I do best" is done at the office, but the
company didn't actually want me doing that work?

Here is a phrasing that corrects the ambiguity that has arisen due to changing
context - work-from-home, side hustles, and millenial work habits:

"For ${companyName}, I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day."


### Q04

This question is open for an opportunity for improvement - making it about the
company or organization. My suggested phrasing:

"In the last week, I have received recognition or praise for doing good work for ${companyName}."

The unmodified phrasing from Gallup leaves open the possibility that the
respondent is giving information unrelated to the company or organization.


### Q05

This question could be more terse, and should avoid the "at work" phrasing
mentioned above.

Note that the phrase "seems to care" cannot be replaced with "cares". Besides
the fact that it deviates too much from the well-measured Q12, it would require
the respondent to have tremendous faith in their own ability to judge caring.
The "seems to care" phrasing allows more doubt on the respondent's behalf.

My suggested alternative phrasing:

"Someone from ${companyName} seems to care about me as a person."


### Q06

In this question about opportunity to develop, the Gallup-standard "at work"
phrasing should be removed for the reasons discussed above. I suggest:

"Someone from ${companyName} encourages my development."


### Q07

In this question about opinions counting, we again should avoid "at work"
phrasing. My alternative:

"In ${companyName}, my opinions seems to count."


### Q08

In this question, the phrase "my company" is ambiguous. Do you mean the
respondent's side hustle business? Even if not, does the respondent even
consider ${companyName} to be "their company"? We must remove the ambiguity.

Also, the phrase "my job" would have been interpreted differently in prior
years than more recently. In prior years, it is more likely that respondents
interpreted "my job" to mean "me in the job that I have with ${companyName}".
Now, it is more likely that respondents interpret "my job" to mean "the role
that I now occupy but which might be occupied by someone else". We must change
the phrasing to achieve the interpretation of the the respondents of prior
years. I suggest "my work for ${companyName}".

My suggestions give rise to this new phrasing:

  > The mission or purpose of ${companyName} makes me feel that my work for
  > ${companyName} is important.
